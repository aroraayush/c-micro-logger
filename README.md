# c-micro-logger
Small utility for logging variables in C language

Currently, this is in early stage. I will work on it, to improve it, time to time. I ll try to keep it as lightweight as possible.

#### Usage
Please download and include the file `micro_logger.h` in the directory of the file where you need to get log outputs. In your file, add `#include "micro_logger.h"` in the beginning

Please look at the `test.c` file to see how to use the header file.
